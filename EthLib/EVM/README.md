# Word correctness contract

`Word` is an abbreviation for `BitVec 256`.
Its constructors, literals and operators remain available.
The checked input policy applies only to `Word.ofNat`.

The source is the [Shanghai Yellow Paper, revision efc5f9a](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/blob/efc5f9a1f356cba376c978eedb63cb0363c2aa85/Paper.tex).
Section 9.1 specifies 256-bit words.
Appendix H.2's arithmetic preamble and ADD result equation specify addition modulo `2^256`.
Checked natural construction is a library boundary policy, not an EVM instruction.

`EthLib.EVM.Proofs.Word.Reference.Value` models naturals below `2^256`.
Its addition uses natural addition followed by remainder modulo `2^256`.
Its constructor checks the bound independently of the executable API.

The kernel checks these contracts for all inputs:

- `decode_encode` and `encode_decode` give both representation round trips.
- `decode_injective` and `decode_surjective` establish a bijection with bounded naturals.
- `ofNat_ok_iff` characterizes success by the bound and the exact returned natural value.
- `ofNat_success_iff` states that some successful result exists exactly for in-range input.
- `ofNat_error_iff` characterizes rejection exactly by `2^256 <= n`.
- `ofNat_toNat` checks every word's observed value back into the same word.
- `ofNat_refines` equates checked construction with the reference model, including errors.
- `toNat_add` and `add_refines` establish modular addition for every pair of words.
- `toNat_lt`, `add_lt` and `modulus_pos` establish the required bounds.
- `add_no_wrap` and `add_wrap` give the two carry cases without restricting operand values further.

The existing commutativity, associativity and zero identity proofs supply algebraic laws.
Boundary examples supplement these universal statements.
They do not establish the contract by themselves.

The machine-checked claim is refinement to this Lean mathematical model.
Correspondence between that model and the cited paper is a human reading of the source.
The contract covers representation, checked natural construction and the addition, unsigned division and unsigned remainder results.
It does not cover all inherited BitVec operations, an interpreter, gas, stack effects or other instructions.
It makes no claim about compiled runtime correctness, cryptography or security.
The precompile modules keep their existing paths and ownership.

`Word.addmod` and `Word.mulmod` model the ADDMOD and MULMOD results.
The first two arguments are arithmetic operands and the third is the modulus.
The sum or product is formed in natural numbers before reduction.
A zero modulus gives zero.

The sources are Cancun execution-specs revision `fd9298410ec7218838c8348f69c1eb633f1797dc`,
`vm/instructions/arithmetic.py`, functions `addmod` and `mulmod`, and the cited
Yellow Paper Appendix H.2 ADDMOD and MULMOD equations.
The proof module gives independent natural-number reference equations, bounds,
commutativity, identities and invariance under reducing the operands first.
The exact equations have no residual reduction modulo `2^256`.
Boundary examples include carries and high product bits.

The source-to-model correspondence is a human interpretation of these sources.
The kernel checks refinement of the word results to that model.
These helpers make no claim about opcode execution, gas, stack or runtime behavior.
